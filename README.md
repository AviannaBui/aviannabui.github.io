# Avianna's Website Portfolio
Hi, my name is Avianna (she/her). I am a junior at Macalester College pursuing a Data Science major along with Psychology, Educational Studies, and Cognitive Science minors. With this academic background, I draw on cognitive psychology and educational frameworks in my data analysis to create responsible data narratives, accessible data visualizations, and multi-perspective data insights to inform and impact sociocultural, business, and educational practices.

Please check out my [website](https://aviannabui.github.io/portfolio_website/) to learn more about my projects!
