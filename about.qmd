:::{#introduction}

Career interest: **human-centered data analytics** & **business intelligence**

I'm a senior at <a href="https://www.macalester.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Macalester College</a> pursuing a <a href="https://www.macalester.edu/mscs/majorsminors/#program-3827" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data Science major</a> along with Psychology and Education minors. This background drives me to draw on cognitive psychology and learning frameworks to deliver insightful data analysis and actionable BI dashboards for business decision-making. I've built my data science and problem-solving skills across multiple industries, including HR and healthcare consulting. Currently, I am working as the **Operational Analytics Intern** at Endeavor Air, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Delta Air Lines.
