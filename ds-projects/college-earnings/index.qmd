The prospect of receiving a high-income job after graduation is one of the most commonly cited reasons for college attendance. However, the financial return of colleges is dependent on a variety of factors, including both college-based factors such as their employability reputation to potential employers and individual-based factors like the majors students decide to pursue. Since colleges’ return on investment can have a cumulative impact on an individual’s lifetime financial prospects, I am inclined to examine the factors that could potentially influence the earnings that college graduates receive. These factors include instructional expenses, control type (public/private), degree offered, and average family income.
