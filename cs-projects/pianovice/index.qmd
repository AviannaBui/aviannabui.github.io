The project features an interactive piano interface that allows users to compose three separate melodies that can be played simultaneously. Our code requires users to install Java 17 in order to use <a href="https://mac-comp127.github.io/kilt-graphics/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kilt-graphics</a>, a graphic library developed by the <a href="https://www.macalester.edu/mscs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science (MSCS)</a> department in Macalester College.
