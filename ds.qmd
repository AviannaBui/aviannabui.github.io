My data science projects apply machine learning algorithms, statistical models, and data visualizations to reveal underlying trends and provide insights across multiple domains of business, psychology, education, and arts. These projects demonstrate my growth as a Data Scientist and Analyst through college courses including Data Visualization, Intermediate Data Science, Statistical Machine Learning, and Statistical Modeling.
