# Avianna's Data Science Portfolio
Hi, my name is Avianna (she/her). Iâ€™m a senior at Macalester College pursuing a Data Science major along with Psychology, Education, and Cognitive Science minors. This background drives me to draw on cognitive psychology and learning frameworks to deliver actionable data insights and accessible visualizations to impact business decision-making and social policies.
