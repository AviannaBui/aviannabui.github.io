:::{#introduction}

Hi, my name is Avianna (she/her). I am a junior at <a href="https://www.macalester.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Macalester College</a> pursuing a <a href="https://www.macalester.edu/mscs/majorsminors/#program-3827" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data Science major</a> along with Psychology, Educational Studies, and Cognitive Science minors. With this academic background, I draw on cognitive psychology and educational frameworks in my data analysis to create responsible data narratives, accessible data visualizations, and multi-perspective data insights to inform and impact sociocultural, business, and educational practices. 

Please check out my Projects and Data Visualizations tabs for examples of my work!
