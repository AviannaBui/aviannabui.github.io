    "section": "",
    "text": "What aspect do hit songs share? With the increasing globalization of the US music industry and the rise of experimental music, it becomes more challenging to determine what features distinguish hits from less popular songs. As music continues to play an integral role in our lives, whether for recreational purposes or as a mechanism for emotional outlets, it is crucial to understand the musical mechanisms that affect their popularity. By examining the factors that influence the success of a song over time, we can gain a deeper insight into music preferences and listeners’ behavior in the United States.\nTo explore the relationship between audio features and popularity, my supervised learning analysis examines the audio features that are the strongest predictors of Spotify Track Popularity by fitting a LASSO, GAM, and a random forest model. I also apply K-means Clustering to investigate if there exist any trends in the dataset across decades and audio features. These analyses allow me to gain a deeper insight into changing music preferences or composition trends in the US music industry over time."

    "text": "Throughout and in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a notable shift towards incorporating technology into education. While educational technology has increased accessibility and flexibility in uncertain times, there are potential consequences due to the inherent lack of social connection and physical activities in online learning. In this project, we aim to investigate this increasing prevalence of educational technology and their impact on the well-being of individuals within this evolving educational landscape."

    "text": "The prospect of receiving a high-income job after graduation is one of the most commonly cited reasons for college attendance. However, the financial return of colleges is dependent on a variety of factors, including both college-based factors such as their employability reputation to potential employers and individual-based factors like the majors students decide to pursue. Since colleges’ return on investment can have a cumulative impact on an individual’s lifetime financial prospects, I am inclined to examine the factors that could potentially influence the earnings that college graduates receive. These factors include instructional expenses, control type (public/private), degree offered, and average family income."

Despite this immense popularity, many Starbucks drinks are unhealthy for our heart. Combined with the fact that heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S., investigating Starbucks’ popularity and nutritional values might help inform people within highly popular Starbucks locations to be more conscious about their drink selections."
