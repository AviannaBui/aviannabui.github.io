My data science projects apply machine learning algorithms, statistical models, and data visualizations to discover trends and tell a story across multiple domains of psychology, education, health, business, and arts. These projects demonstrate my growth as a Data Scientist through the knowledge I learn in college courses including Data Visualization, Intermediate Data Science, Statistical Machine Learning, and Statistical Modeling.
